Some Machine Learning basic execises


1) Wines Quality Dataset
    - Read data from archive
        In this case, it is a csv with header, separator is ‘;’ The download url is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/winequality/winequality-red.csv
        Use the read_csv() method of pandas dataframe https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html 
        Use df as the dataframe name 
        In this dataset the column names are already included in the .csv ﬁle

2) Iris Dataset
    - Look at the ".names" text ﬁle in the Data Folder, read (visually) the  column names and store them in a list 
    - the url is ’https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data’ 
    - read the ﬁle with read_csv using also the names parameter
    - show the head of the ﬁle, just for a quick inspection

3) Adult Dataset
    - Look at the ".names" text ﬁle in the Data Folder, read (visually) the  column names and store them in a list
